# MobyDick - Find number of occurence of 100 most frequent words.

<b>Project Description:</b>

This project is a test driven development project. There are two files mobydick.txt and stop-words.txt. 
The tests find out the number of occurrences of 100 most frequent words in mobydick.txt excluding some stop words
which are the list of words in stop-words.txt.

I have created this project in Eclipse. I have used test driven development for this project and used jUnit for testing.
First I wrote the test cases and gave the definition of those test cases but did not implemented it.
I wrote just enough code to pass the test cases. For Coverage, I have used a plugin EclEmma Java Code Coverage 3.0.0 in Eclipse.

<b>Prerequisites</b>

Java - 1.8.0_101 <br />
jdk - 1.8.0_101 <br />
Eclipse Neon <br />
jUnit <br />
EclEmma Java Code Coverage 3.0.0 <br />
