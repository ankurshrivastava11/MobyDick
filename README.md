I have created this project in Eclipse. I have used test driven development for this project and used jUnit for testing.
First I wrote the test cases and gave the definition of those test cases but did not implemented it.
I wrote just enough code to pass the test cases. For Coverage, I have used a plugin EclEmma Java Code Coverage 3.0.0 in Eclipse.
