# MobyDick - Find number of occurence of 100 most frequent words.

<b>Project Description:</b>

This project is a test driven development project. There are two files mobydick.txt and stop-words.txt. 
The tests find out the number of occurrences of 100 most frequent words in mobydick.txt excluding some stop words
which are the list of words in stop-words.txt.

I have created this project in Eclipse. I have used test driven development for this project and used jUnit for testing.
First I wrote the test cases and gave the definition of those test cases but did not implemented it.
I wrote just enough code to pass the test cases. For Coverage, I have used a plugin EclEmma Java Code Coverage 3.0.0 in Eclipse.

<b>Prerequisites</b>

Java - 1.8.0_101 <br />
jdk - 1.8.0_101 <br />
Eclipse Neon <br />
jUnit <br />
EclEmma Java Code Coverage 3.0.0 <br />

<b>Getting Started</b>
- Download the zip or fork or clone the project from this repository into your local machine.
- Open Eclipse and import the downloaded code from the zip into your workspace from the File option.
- Install the plugin EclEmma Java Code Coverage 3.0.0 in Eclipse using Eclipse MarketPlace for generation of code coverage.


<b>Installing and running the test</b>
1. Download the zip or fork or clone the project from this repository into your local machine.
2. Import the downloaded code from the zip into your workspace from the File option.
3. After successful import, navigate to test/occurencetest/testoccurence.java.
4. Right click on the file and choose Run As - jUnit Test and the tests will successfully pass with the result getting shown in the console.
5. To find out the coverage:
  - Install the plugin EclEmma Java Code Coverage 3.0.0 in Eclipse using Eclipse MarketPlace.
  - After Successful installation, restart the eclipse and navigate to test/occurencetest/testoccurence.java.
  - Right click on the file and choose Coverage as - jUnit Test.
  - After completion, check the result in the coverage tab.
